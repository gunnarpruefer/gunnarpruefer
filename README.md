## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Agile at heart. I like KISS, I like YAGNI, I dislike Not-invented-here-syndrome.

### About me

20+ years of Java, Java EE and Spring.

Thankful for the great IT and Java ecosystem. It truly is standing on the shoulders of giants.

Happy when coding. 

(But also happy when laying wooden railroad tracks through our living room. Happy when playing with Lego and the kids. Happy when running. Happy when the sun is shining...)
